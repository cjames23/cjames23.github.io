    "content": "I set out to build this website as a way to learn Rust as a new language to me. \n I started off my career coding in Python and then later Java as I have worked on developer productivity with Gradle. \n Rust has so many interesting use cases on its own but also I find myself drawn to trying to use Rust \n along with PyO3 and Maturin to make better Python libraries.",
